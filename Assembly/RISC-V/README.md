# An Introduction To Assembly Programming

In this course we will discover the art of Assembly programming with the example of the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA). Even though we are using RISC-V many concepts we learn in this course apply to any architecture.

The ability to read and write code in low-level Assembly language is a powerful skill to understand the processes that are going on behind-the-scenes.

To understand Assembly properly we have to understand low-level concepts like binary manipulation, main components of a computer and how these components interact with one another, how programs written in a higher level language are compiled into an executable file which the processor can read and understand and so on.

This course aims to introduce these concepts at an introductory level with animations and illustrations to facilitate an easy understanding.

## Execution Of A Program

A native program is a program encoded using instructions that can be directly executed by the computer hardware without help from an emulator or a virtual machine. These programs consist of instructions which are simple operations such as adding or comparing two numbers. By executing multiple of these simple instructions a computer is capable of solving complex problems.

The basic unit of information on computers is a binary digit, or a "bit" which are represented as "1" or "0". Information and instructions are encoded as sequences of bits.
