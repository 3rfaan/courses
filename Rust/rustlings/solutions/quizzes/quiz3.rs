// An imaginary magical school has a new report card generation system written
// in Rust! Currently, the system only supports creating report cards where the
// student's grade is represented numerically (e.g. 1.0 -> 5.5). However, the
// school also issues alphabetical grades (A+ -> F-) and needs to be able to
// print both types of report card!
//
// Make the necessary code changes in the struct `ReportCard` and the impl
// block to support alphabetical report cards in addition to numerical ones.

// TODO: Adjust the struct as described above.
struct ReportCard<T> {
    grade: T,
    student_name: String,
    student_age: u8,
}

// TODO: Adjust the impl block as described above.
