# Generics

Generics is the topic of generalizing types and functionalities to broader cases.
This is extremely useful for reducing code duplication in many ways, but can call for rather involving syntax.
Namely, being generic requires taking great care to specify over which types a generic type is actually considered valid.
The simplest and most common use of generics is for type parameters.
