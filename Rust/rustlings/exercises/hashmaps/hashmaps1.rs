// hashmaps1.rs
// A basket of fruits in the form of a hash map needs to be defined.
// The key represents the name of the fruit and the value represents
// how many of that particular fruit is in the basket. You have to put
// at least three different types of fruits (e.g apple, banana, mango)
// in the basket and the total count of all the fruits should be at
// least five.
//
// Make me compile and pass the tests!
//
// Execute `rustlings hint hashmaps1` or use the `hint` watch subcommand for a hint.

// I AM NOT DONE
