// In this exercise, we are given a `Vec` of `u32` called `numbers` with values
// ranging from 0 to 99. We would like to use this set of numbers within 8
// different threads simultaneously. Each thread is going to get the sum of
// every eighth value with an offset.
//
// The first thread (offset 0), will sum 0, 8, 16, …
// The second thread (offset 1), will sum 1, 9, 17, …
// The third thread (offset 2), will sum 2, 10, 18, …
// …
// The eighth thread (offset 7), will sum 7, 15, 23, …
//
// Each thread should own a reference-counting pointer to the vector of
// numbers. But `Rc` isn't thread-safe. Therefore, we need to use `Arc`.
//
// Don't get distracted by how threads are spawned and joined. We will practice
// that later in the exercises about threads.

// Don't change the lines below.
