// quiz3.rs
// This quiz tests:
// - Generics
// - Traits
// An imaginary magical school has a new report card generation system written in Rust!
// Currently the system only supports creating report cards where the student's grade
// is represented numerically (e.g. 1.0 -> 5.5).
// However, the school also issues alphabetical grades (A+ -> F-) and needs
// to be able to print both types of report card!

// Make the necessary code changes in the struct ReportCard and the impl block
// to support alphabetical report cards. Change the Grade in the second test to "A+"
// to show that your changes allow alphabetical grades.

// Execute `rustlings hint quiz3` or use the `hint` watch subcommand for a hint.

// I AM NOT DONE
