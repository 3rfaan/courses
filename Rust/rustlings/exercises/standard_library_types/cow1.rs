// This exercise explores the Cow, or Clone-On-Write type.
// Cow is a clone-on-write smart pointer.
// It can enclose and provide immutable access to borrowed data, and clone the data lazily when mutation or ownership is required.
// The type is designed to work with general borrowed data via the Borrow trait.
